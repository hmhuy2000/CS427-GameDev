# Introduction
Cat’s Home is a  2D platform game application, in which players have to reach the top of the sky where a witch is waiting as fast as possible before the timer counts down.
It is also an offline single-player and 2-player game, so everyone can play with their friends and family.
The characters, menu, and music are inspired from the 90s games.
